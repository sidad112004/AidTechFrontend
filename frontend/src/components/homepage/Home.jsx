              We are developing a help-exchange platform where users can request assistance anytime,
              categorized into ten levels based on urgency. Each help request deducts a specific amount of coins from
              the requester’s account and credits them to the helper. Coins act as a trust-based currency,
              encouraging community-driven support. Users can earn coins by offering assistance and use them when they need help.
              The system ensures fairness, reliability, and accountability in transactions. Our goal is to create a seamless,
              secure, and rewarding support network. The platform will feature real-time matching, ensuring timely aid distribution.
              Together, we build a self-sustaining ecosystem of support and goodwill.

              Our platform is an assistance-sharing solution that links individuals in need with those willing to help.
              Requests are organized into ten tiers of urgency so that higher-priority needs are addressed first.
              A coin-based system governs the transactions—users accumulate coins by offering help and spend them when requesting support.
              To ensure fairness and dependability, the platform includes real-time matching, secure transactions, and transparent tracking.
              The intuitive interface enables easy navigation, while instant alerts keep users promptly connected.
              Location-based features, user authentication, and a review system further enhance trust and accountability.
              By cultivating a self-sustaining community, our solution encourages responsible involvement and collaborative assistance,
              building a scalable and reliable support network.
